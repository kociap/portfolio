                    My name is Piotr Kocia.
                    I am a hobbyist C++ and C game engine programmer passionate about performant, deterministic and
                    reliable software.
                    I have background experience in competitive programming and Front-End development.

                            A simulation of objects in a 2D gravitational field I created as the final project for my
                            university programming course. The simulation uses the Verlet integration method to solve
                            the equation of motion of objects in the gravitational field.

                            A library for generating and manipulating all sorts of 3D gizmos. The API exposes functions

                            C++ compilation times are notoriously slow. The standard library headers are large and can
                            take even seconds to compile (for example the <code>&lt;filesystem&gt;</code> header). The
                            main idea behind anton_core is blazing fast compilation with its headers taking 1-10ms.
                            Additionally, the library is highly customizable for my purposes, has features from future
                            C++ standards (for example the stacktrace API from C++23) and improvements over the existing
                            ones (for example assert with a message and the stacktrace), provides cleaner API in certain
                            cases than std (for instance the equivalent of <code>std::vector</code>
                            (<code>anton::Array</code>) can be uniformly initialized using <code>{}</code> and instead
                            of <code>std::initializer_list</code> it uses a variadic constructor with tag dispatch to
                            achieve the same result with an added benefit of supporting move semantics).

                            mimas is a windowing and system abstraction framework written in C created specifically for
                            use in game engines and games. It is by design cross-platform and cross-backend, however,
                            currently the only fully supported platform is Windows. The api provides access to
                            windowing, file dialogs, time, input and is designed with UTF-8
                            in mind. My initial motivation for creating mimas was the lack of direct (yet abstracted)
                            access to input devices, such as keyboard, and coupling of OpenGL contexts to OS windows in
                            the existing frameworks. Currently, my goal is
                            to modernize the C API, by for example using views instead of null-terminators where
                            possible, and provide a finer control over the event loop to make the entire framework more
                            flexible. Additionally, I want to add an API for direct access to the connected gamepads and
                            improve the existing Displays API.
