                        Game engine I've written in C++17 and inted to use to build a hack and slash dungeon crawler.
                        The engine uses OpenGL 4.5 Core for rendering, mimas for windowing, input and time, and is designed around ECS and jobs.
                        Additionally, it features:

                        mimas is a windowing and system abstraction framework written in C created specifically for use in game engines and games.
                        It is by design cross-platform and cross-backend, however, currently the only fully supported platform is Windows.
                        We are planning to add support for Wayland, X11 and Android. 
                        The api provides access to windowing, file dialogs, time, input and is designed with UTF-8 in mind.
